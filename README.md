# Hi! Our next Sphinxer
This is a test for you before becoming an amazing developer @sphinx!

- We pre-setting up a `npm test` command, you should run that command, then you'll see it failing
- Our requirement is just simple: Make it pass!
- Other require will come-in by the interviewer(s)!
- There are few levels of the time box:
    
    - Less than a minute: You are amazing!
    - Less then 5 minutes: Awesome!
    - Less then 30 minutes: Great!

See you in the interview!
Happy coding and testing! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
